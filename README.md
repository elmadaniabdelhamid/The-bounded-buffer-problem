Producer-Consumer Java Project

- Overview:
This project demonstrates the classic Producer-Consumer problem using Java.
The Producer-Consumer problem is a synchronization problem that involves ensuring that producers (who produce data and add it to a buffer)
and consumers (who take data from the buffer) operate without running into race conditions.
This project uses Java's synchronized methods. It features a graphical user interface (GUI) to simulate the production and consumption of products.

- Features
Producers can add products to the buffer if the product does not already exist.
Consumers can consume products from the buffer if they exist.
The GUI allows users to:
Add new products with a name and price.
Consume products by specifying the product name.
View the list of available products after each consumption.
