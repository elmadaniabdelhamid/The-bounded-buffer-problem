## Producer-Consumer with JAVA

# Overview:
This project demonstrates the classic Producer-Consumer problem using Java.
The Producer-Consumer problem is a synchronization problem that involves ensuring that producers (who produce data and add it to a buffer)
and consumers (who take data from the buffer) operate without running into race conditions.
This project uses Java's synchronized methods. It features a graphical user interface (GUI) to simulate the production and consumption of products.
